# Introduction

This report leverages SQL to analyze customer behavior and purchasing trends through Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) segmentation. The goal is to provide insights into customer engagement and inform targeted marketing strategies, helping businesses identify high-value, loyal, at-risk, and new customers.

The analysis begins by calculating the average number of customers per month (Q1), providing an overview of customer engagement. It then identifies the best-selling products in each country (Q2), guiding inventory and marketing decisions.

Next, customer RFM scores are calculated (Q3) to assess purchasing behavior based on recency, frequency, and monetary value. Customers are further segmented by their RFM scores (Q4) into groups such as loyal and at-risk.

A total RFM score is calculated by summing recency, frequency, and monetary quintiles (Q5), offering a comprehensive view of customer engagement. Finally, customers are classified for targeted marketing (Q6) into segments like 'Champions' and 'Churners', enabling personalized marketing strategies.

This report provides actionable insights into customer behavior and segmentation, allowing businesses to refine their marketing efforts. By identifying high-value customers, potential loyalists, and churn risks, businesses can focus on retention and optimize sales strategies.


# Recommendation
#### **Finding 1**
To stabilize quarterly operations, Kogan must address the significant variation in consumer spending across months. Implementing stimulus points akin to Asian platforms like Shopee, with strategic sales events on special days or during commuting hours, can boost consumer interest during low-spending months like January to April and July.

#### **Finding 2**:
Kogan's sales performance varies across regions in Australia, indicating market strength. However, other markets shouldn't be neglected. Leveraging historical data to tap into diverse regional markets can optimize sales potential. In New Zealand, capital market surveys are overdue, while Papua New Guinea presents opportunities for selling refurbished or low-inventory items to price-conscious consumers.

#### **Finding 3**
Amid economic challenges in 2021-2022, Kogan witnessed decreased spending across all customer segments, impacting profits. Adapting product offerings to match evolving trends and economic conditions, along with strategic marketing initiatives like discounts and bundled offers, can stimulate consumer interest and mitigate profit losses. Leveraging its Chinese supply chain can provide cost advantages and enable Kogan to compete effectively.

#### **Finding 4** 
Converting churners into recent customers requires proactive measures and strategic communication, possibly through personalized email promotions during holidays or seasonal changes. Additionally, Kogan must review purchasing policies, product quality, and shipping processes to enhance customer satisfaction. Staying ahead of smart device trends and leveraging AI for customer understanding and brand loyalty reinforcement are critical for sustained success against competitors like Alibaba and Amazon.
