# Introduction

This report leverages SQL to analyze customer behavior and purchasing trends through Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) segmentation. The goal is to provide insights into customer engagement and inform targeted marketing strategies, helping businesses identify high-value, loyal, at-risk, and new customers.

The analysis begins by calculating the average number of customers per month (Q1), providing an overview of customer engagement. It then identifies the best-selling products in each country (Q2), guiding inventory and marketing decisions.

Next, customer RFM scores are calculated (Q3) to assess purchasing behavior based on recency, frequency, and monetary value. Customers are further segmented by their RFM scores (Q4) into groups such as loyal and at-risk.

A total RFM score is calculated by summing recency, frequency, and monetary quintiles (Q5), offering a comprehensive view of customer engagement. Finally, customers are classified for targeted marketing (Q6) into segments like 'Champions' and 'Churners', enabling personalized marketing strategies.

This report provides actionable insights into customer behavior and segmentation, allowing businesses to refine their marketing efforts. By identifying high-value customers, potential loyalists, and churn risks, businesses can focus on retention and optimize sales strategies.
